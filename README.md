# Forest plots in practical use: Implementation and interpretation

## Welcome!


Welcome to the pre-PAGE 2022 workshop on *Forest plots in practical use*, given by Pharmetheus and tutored by Niclas Jonsson and Joakim Nyberg.

The workshop will take place on Tuesday 28th of June, 2022 (09:00-17:00 CEST/GMT+2), in connection to PAGE, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The registration page and workshop description can be found at the [PAGE website](https://www.page-meeting.org/default.asp?id=47&keuze=meeting&mid=23).

The intention with this page is to give practical information regarding system requirements for the hands-on sessions and installation instructions for R-packages, as well as links to the course material.

## Workshop overview

The workshop aims at mixing lectures and hands-on sessions to provide an in-depth understanding of Forest plots, both from a theoretical as well as practical perspective.

The workshop runs between 09:00 and 17:00, with breaks for lunch and coffee.

The detailed course schedule can be found [here](https://github.com/ForestCoursePAGE2022/ForestCoursePAGE2022/blob/main/PAGE%202022%20Forest%20plot%20workshop%20schedule.pdf).


## Requirements

To be able to participate in the hands-on excercises you will have to bring yoor own laptop, which should have R and RStudio installed. The execises also require that a certain set of R-packages are installed. 

It is also preferable if the R-packages necessary for the hands-on exercises are installed before the workshop starts. We have created installer scripts for different R-versions and operating systems (see below).

There will be Pharmetheus representatives available between 08:00 and 09:00 on the day of the workshop day to assist in the installation of the packages in case help is needed. However, the installation instructions are intended to be self-explanatory and easy to follow so hopefully no help will be needed.

### R-version

The PMXForest package, the workshop examples and hands-on excercises have been tested on the lates version of MacOS and Windows using R versions 3.6, 4.1 and 4.2, and on Linux with R-version 4.2. Should you need to use another R-version, please let us know before the course so that we can make sure everything works as intended.


### Installation of R-packages

To minimize the risk of R-package conflicts you will be able to download an installation package that contains all packages needed. With the help of the accompanying installation scipt you can install them in a way that should not create conflict with any existing R-package installations and that does not require administrator priviliges. Use the link in the side panel to download the installation script that fits your system 

At the course there will one additional package to install - PMXForest, which is the package that contains all the Forest plot specific functionality and that will be used during the hands-on sessions.
