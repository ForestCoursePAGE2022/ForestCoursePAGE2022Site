# Forest plots in practical use: Implementation and interpretation

## Welcome!


Welcome to the pre-PAGE 2022 workshop on *Forest plots in practical use*, given by Pharmetheus and tutored by Niclas Jonsson and Joakim Nyberg.

The workshop will take place on Tuesday 28th of June, 2022 (09:00-17:00 CEST/GMT+2), in connection to PAGE, in Ljubljana, Slovenia. The registration page and workshop description can be found at the [PAGE website](https://www.page-meeting.org/default.asp?id=47&keuze=meeting&mid=23).

The intention with this page is to give practical information regarding system requirements for the hands-on sessions and installation instructions for R-packages, as well as links to the course material.

## Workshop overview

The workshop aims at mixing lectures and hands-on sessions to provide an in-depth understanding of Forest plots, both from a theoretical as well as practical perspective.

The workshop runs between 09:00 and 17:00, with breaks for lunch and coffee.

The detailed course schedule can be found [here](https://github.com/ForestCoursePAGE2022/ForestCoursePAGE2022/blob/main/PAGE%202022%20Forest%20plot%20workshop%20schedule.pdf).


## Requirements

To be able to do the excercises in the hands-on excercises you will have to bring your own laptop, which should have R and RStudio installed. The execises also require that a certain set of R-packages are installed. 

### R-version

The PMXForest package (see below), the workshop examples and hands-on excercises have been tested on the lates version of MacOS and Windows using R versions 3.6, 4.1 and 4.2, and on Linux with R-version 4.2. Should you need to use another R-version, please let us know before the course so that we can make sure everything works as intended.

### Installation of R-packages

It is  preferable if the R-packages necessary for the hands-on exercises are installed before the workshop starts. The exact list of packages needed is provided in the "Package Installation" link to the left. The link alos includes an installation script that you can use to install any missing packages in a way that should not affect any existing R-package installations and that does not require administrator priviliges.

There will be Pharmetheus representatives available between 08:00 and 09:00 on the day of the workshop day as well as during the workshop to assist in the installation of the packages in case help is needed. 

### The PMXForest package

The lectures and hands-on excercises use functionality from the PMXForest package. This packgage will be provided under the link "PMXForest package" to the left. I will have to be installed on your computer according to the instructions provided. Similar to the otehr package requirement this installation will not affect any existing R-package installations will not require administrator priviliges.


## Course material

### Handouts

Lecture handouts will be provided via the "Handouts" link to the left.

## Hands-on material

The hands-on instructions will also be made available via the links to the left as well as the corresponding answers (available after the hands-on session).


## Staying in contact

The link "Discussion forum" to the left leads to a discussion forum which can be used to communicate with the course teachers, other participants, get help (after the workshop), report bugs and/or suggest addition to feaures in the PMXForest package.
